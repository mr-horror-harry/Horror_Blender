# Horror_Blender

• This is my new repo to maintain my blender 3D object models.

• Feel free to use it and get benefited out of it.

• Note: Some of the objects are still under build, but would be complteted sooner.

• Most/All of the models are only formed from very basic mesh or curves only.

• All the objects developed belongs to horror-harry and not imported from any source irrespective of the reference used.
